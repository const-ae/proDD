After analyzing your samples on a mass spectrometer, you want to find out if 
there are interesting patterns in the data. But the first challenge is how
do you get the data from the files that your machine produces into R?

In the following, I will describe several ways of importing data from MaxQuant.
MaxQuant is a popular tool for identifying, integrating, and combining MS peaks
to derive peptide and protein intensities. MaxQuant produces serveral output
files including **proteinGroups.txt**. It is usually a tab separated table with 
a lot of different columns, which can make it difficult to not get overwhelmed
with information. 

The most important columns that every proteinGroups.txt file contains are

* *Protein IDs*: a semicolon delimited text listing all protein identifiers
  that match an identified set of peptides. Most of the time this is just a 
  single protein, but sometimes proteins are so similar to each other because
  of gene duplication  that it was not possible to differentiate them.

* *Majority protein IDs*: a semicolon delimited text that lists all proteins 
  from the *Protein IDs* column which had more than half of their peptides 
  identified.
  
* *Identification type [SAMPLENAME]*: For each sample there is one column that 
  explains how the peptide peaks where identified. Either they were directly
  sequenced by the MS2 ("By MS/MS") or by matching the m/z peak and elution timing
  across samples ("By matching").

* *Intensity [SAMPLENAME]*: The combined intensity of the peptides of the protein.
  Missing or non-identified proteins are simply stored as `0`. In a label-free 
  experiment, this is also often called *LFQ Intensity [SAMPLENAME]*.
  
* *iBAQ [SAMPLENAME]*: iBAQ is short for intensity-based absolute quantification.
  It is an attempt to make intensity values comparable across proteins. Usually
  the intensity values are only relative, which means that they are only 
  comparable within one peptide. This is because differences in ionization 
  and detection efficiency. For this is reason it is usually better to just
  compare the *Intensity* for finding differentially detected proteins.
  
 * *Only identified by site*: Contains a "+" if the protein was only identified by
   a modification site. <br />
   *Reverse*:  Contains a "+" if the protein matches the reversed part of the
   decoy database. <br />
   *Contaminant*: Contains a "+" if the protein is a commonly occurring
   contaminant. <br />
   These three columns are commonly used to filter out false hits.


Our goal is to turn this complicated matrix into a useable matrix or a 
`SummarizedExperiment` object. There are several ways to achieve this, which I 
will explain in greater detail:

1. Use the base R functions (`read.delim()` and `[<-`) to read in the data
2. Use the `tidyverse` to load the file and turn it into a useable object
3. Use the `proteus` package and the `readProteinGroups()` function
4. Use the `DEP` package and the `import_MaxQuant()` function


This package comes with an example file that contains the LFQ data from a BioID
experiment in *Drosophila melanogaster*. 11 different Palmitoyltransferases 
(short DHHC) were tagged with a promiscuous biotin ligase and all biotinylated
proteins were enriched and identified using label-free mass spectrometry. The
conditions are named after the tagged DHHC and the negetive control condition 
is called S2R for the cell line. Each condition was measured in triplicates,
which means that there are a total of 36 conditions. To make the file smaller,
I provide a reduced data set which only contains the first 122 rows of the data.

# Base R

The example file is located in

```{r}
system.file("extdata/proteinGroups.txt", 
            package = "proDD", mustWork = TRUE)
```

In this specific file, all spaces have been replaced with dots. This is an 
example how each output file from MaxQuant slightly differs. This can make it 
difficult to write a generic import function. Instead I will first demonstrate
the most general approach which is to simply use the base R tools for loading
the data and turning it into useful objects.

The first step is to load the full table.

```{r}
full_data <- read.delim(
    system.file("extdata/proteinGroups.txt", 
                package = "proDD", mustWork = TRUE),
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

head(colnames(full_data))
```

Next, I  create a matrix of the intensity data, where each sample is a column and
each protein group is a row.

```{r}
# I use a regular expression (regex) to select the intensity columns
intensity_colnames <- colnames(full_data)[grepl("^LFQ\\.intensity\\.", 
                                                colnames(full_data))]

# New data set which only contains the intensity columns
data <- as.matrix(full_data[, intensity_colnames])
colnames(data) <- sub("^LFQ\\.intensity\\.", "", intensity_colnames)
data[1:7, 1:6]
rownames(data) <- full_data$Protein.IDs
```


In the next step I will create an annotation `data.frame` that contains information 
on the sample name, the condition and the replicate.


```{r}
annotation_df <- data.frame(
    Condition = sub("\\.\\d+", "", sub("^LFQ\\.intensity\\.", 
                                       "", intensity_colnames)),
    Replicate = as.numeric(sub("^LFQ\\.intensity\\.[[:alnum:]]+\\.", 
                               "", intensity_colnames)),
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE, row.names = colnames(data)
)
head(annotation_df)
```

Optionally, we can turn this into a `SummarizedExperiment` or `MSnSet` object

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(SummarizedExperiment)
library(MSnbase)
```


```{r}
library(SummarizedExperiment)
se <- SummarizedExperiment(SimpleList(LFQ=data), colData=annotation_df)
rowData(se) <- full_data[, c("Only.identified.by.site", 
                             "Reverse", "Potential.contaminant")]
se
```


```{r}
library(MSnbase)

fData <- AnnotatedDataFrame(full_data[, c("Only.identified.by.site", 
                                 "Reverse", "Potential.contaminant")])
rownames(fData) <- rownames(data)
ms <- MSnSet(data, pData=AnnotatedDataFrame(annotation_df), fData=fData)
ms
```




# Tidyverse


The tidyverse is a set of coherent R packages that provide many useful functions
for common data analysis tasks. It replicates many of the functionalities 
already available in base R packages, but learns from its mistakes and avoids 
some of the suprising behaviors. For example strings are never automatically
converted to factors. Another popular feature in the tidyverse is the pipe 
operator (`%>%`) that makes it easy to chain complex transformations.


```{r, include=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
library(tibble)
```


```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
library(tibble)
# Or short 
# library(tidyverse)
```


I first load the full data file

```{r}
# The read_tsv function works faster and more reliable than read.delim
# But it sometimes needs help to identify the right type for each column,
# because it looks only at the first 1,000 elements. 
# I do that here for the Reverse column.
full_data <- read_tsv(
    system.file("extdata/proteinGroups.txt", 
                package = "proDD", mustWork = TRUE),
    col_types = cols(Reverse = col_character())
)

full_data
```

Next, I create a tidy version of the data set. I pipe (`%>%`) the
results from each transformation to the next transformation, to
first `select` the columns of interest, reshape (`gather`) the dataset from 
wide to long format, and lastly create new columns with `mutate`.

```{r}
tidy_data <- full_data %>%
    dplyr::select(ProteinID=Protein.IDs, starts_with("LFQ.intensity.")) %>%
    gather(Sample, Intensity, starts_with("LFQ.intensity.")) %>%
    mutate(Condition = str_match(Sample, 
                 "LFQ\\.intensity\\.([[:alnum:]]+)\\.\\d+")[,2]) %>%
    mutate(Replicate = as.numeric(str_match(Sample, 
                 "LFQ\\.intensity\\.[[:alnum:]]+\\.(\\d+)")[,2])) %>%
    mutate(SampleName = paste0(Condition, ".", Replicate))

tidy_data
```

Using the tidy data, I create the annotation data frame and the data matrix.

```{r}
data <- tidy_data %>%
    select(ProteinID, SampleName, Intensity) %>%
    spread(SampleName, Intensity) %>%
    column_to_rownames("ProteinID") %>%
    as.matrix()

annotation_df <- tidy_data %>%
    select(SampleName, Condition, Replicate) %>%
    distinct() %>%
    arrange(Condition, Replicate) %>%
    as.data.frame() %>%
    column_to_rownames("SampleName")
```


Optionally, we can again turn this into a `SummarizedExperiment` or `MSnSet` object


```{r}
library(SummarizedExperiment)
se <- SummarizedExperiment(SimpleList(LFQ=data), colData=annotation_df)
rowData(se) <- full_data[, c("Only.identified.by.site", 
                             "Reverse", "Potential.contaminant")]
se
```


```{r}
library(MSnbase)

fData <- AnnotatedDataFrame(full_data[, c("Only.identified.by.site", 
                                 "Reverse", "Potential.contaminant")])
rownames(fData) <- rownames(data)
ms <- MSnSet(data, pData=AnnotatedDataFrame(annotation_df), fData=fData)
ms
```


# Proteus

Proteus is an R package specifically designed for the analysis of MaxQuant
output.

```{r}
library(proteus)
```

To load the data I use the `readProteinGroups()` function. It needs a vector
of all column names that contain the intensity values, which are stored in the
`meta` data frame.

```{r}
meta <- data.frame(
    sample = c("LFQ.intensity.CG1407.01", "LFQ.intensity.CG1407.02",  "LFQ.intensity.CG1407.03",  "LFQ.intensity.CG4676.01",  "LFQ.intensity.CG4676.02", "LFQ.intensity.CG4676.03", "LFQ.intensity.CG51963.01", "LFQ.intensity.CG51963.02", "LFQ.intensity.CG51963.03","LFQ.intensity.CG5620A.01", "LFQ.intensity.CG5620A.02", "LFQ.intensity.CG5620A.03", "LFQ.intensity.CG5620B.01","LFQ.intensity.CG5620B.02", "LFQ.intensity.CG5620B.03", "LFQ.intensity.CG5880.01", "LFQ.intensity.CG5880.02",  "LFQ.intensity.CG5880.03",  "LFQ.intensity.CG6017.01",  "LFQ.intensity.CG6017.02", "LFQ.intensity.CG6017.03", "LFQ.intensity.CG6618.01",  "LFQ.intensity.CG6618.02",  "LFQ.intensity.CG6618.03",  "LFQ.intensity.CG6627.01", "LFQ.intensity.CG6627.02", "LFQ.intensity.CG6627.03",  "LFQ.intensity.CG8314.01", "LFQ.intensity.CG8314.02",  "LFQ.intensity.CG8314.03", "LFQ.intensity.GsbPI.001", "LFQ.intensity.GsbPI.002",  "LFQ.intensity.GsbPI.003",  "LFQ.intensity.S2R.01", "LFQ.intensity.S2R.02", "LFQ.intensity.S2R.03"),
   condition = c("CG1407", "CG1407", "CG1407", "CG4676", "CG4676", "CG4676", "CG51963", "CG51963", "CG51963", "CG5620A", "CG5620A", "CG5620A", "CG5620B", "CG5620B", "CG5620B", "CG5880", "CG5880", "CG5880", "CG6017", "CG6017", "CG6017", "CG6618", "CG6618", "CG6618", "CG6627", "CG6627", "CG6627", "CG8314", "CG8314", "CG8314", "GsbPI", "GsbPI", "GsbPI", "S2R", "S2R", "S2R" ),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)


head(meta)

# The columns in the example file are separated with a dot instead of a space
data_col_names <- list(protein = "Majority.protein.IDs", reverse = "Reverse", 
                       contaminant = "Potential.contaminant")

proteus_data <- readProteinGroups(
            file = system.file("extdata/proteinGroups.txt",
            package = "proDD", mustWork = TRUE),
            meta = meta, measure.cols = setNames(meta$sample, meta$sample),
            data.cols = data_col_names)
```

After loading the data I turn the `proteusData` object into a useable matrix
and create the annotation data frame.

```{r}
data <- proteus_data$tab
annotation_df <- proteus_data$metadata
rownames(annotation_df) <- annotation_df$sample
annotation_df$sample <- NULL
```


Optionally, we can again turn this into a `SummarizedExperiment` or `MSnSet` object

```{r}
library(SummarizedExperiment)
se <- SummarizedExperiment(SimpleList(LFQ=data), colData=annotation_df)
se
```


```{r}
library(MSnbase)

fData <- AnnotatedDataFrame(data.frame(row.names = rownames(data)))
ms <- MSnSet(data, pData=AnnotatedDataFrame(annotation_df), fData=fData)
ms
```


# DEP

DEP has a similar motivation as `proteus`. It provides helper functions
to impute missing values and makes it easy to call `limma` on the result.

To load the data, we again need to provide all the column names of the 
intensity values. I then call the `import_MaxQuant()` function that directly 
creates a `SummarizedExperiment` object.

```{r}
library(DEP)

full_data <- read.delim(
    system.file("extdata/proteinGroups.txt", 
                package = "proDD", mustWork = TRUE),
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)


exp_design <- data.frame(
    label =c("LFQ.intensity.CG1407.01", "LFQ.intensity.CG1407.02",  "LFQ.intensity.CG1407.03",  "LFQ.intensity.CG4676.01",  "LFQ.intensity.CG4676.02", "LFQ.intensity.CG4676.03", "LFQ.intensity.CG51963.01", "LFQ.intensity.CG51963.02", "LFQ.intensity.CG51963.03","LFQ.intensity.CG5620A.01", "LFQ.intensity.CG5620A.02", "LFQ.intensity.CG5620A.03", "LFQ.intensity.CG5620B.01","LFQ.intensity.CG5620B.02", "LFQ.intensity.CG5620B.03", "LFQ.intensity.CG5880.01", "LFQ.intensity.CG5880.02",  "LFQ.intensity.CG5880.03",  "LFQ.intensity.CG6017.01",  "LFQ.intensity.CG6017.02", "LFQ.intensity.CG6017.03", "LFQ.intensity.CG6618.01",  "LFQ.intensity.CG6618.02",  "LFQ.intensity.CG6618.03",  "LFQ.intensity.CG6627.01", "LFQ.intensity.CG6627.02", "LFQ.intensity.CG6627.03",  "LFQ.intensity.CG8314.01", "LFQ.intensity.CG8314.02",  "LFQ.intensity.CG8314.03", "LFQ.intensity.GsbPI.001", "LFQ.intensity.GsbPI.002",  "LFQ.intensity.GsbPI.003",  "LFQ.intensity.S2R.01", "LFQ.intensity.S2R.02", "LFQ.intensity.S2R.03"),
   condition = c("CG1407", "CG1407", "CG1407", "CG4676", "CG4676", "CG4676", "CG51963", "CG51963", "CG51963", "CG5620A", "CG5620A", "CG5620A", "CG5620B", "CG5620B", "CG5620B", "CG5880", "CG5880", "CG5880", "CG6017", "CG6017", "CG6017", "CG6618", "CG6618", "CG6618", "CG6627", "CG6627", "CG6627", "CG8314", "CG8314", "CG8314", "GsbPI", "GsbPI", "GsbPI", "S2R", "S2R", "S2R" ),
   replicate = rep(1:3, times=12),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

se <- import_MaxQuant(full_data, exp_design)
se
assay(se)[1:5, 1:5]
```
